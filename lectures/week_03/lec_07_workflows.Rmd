## Goals for today

* Understand different workflow models

> - Understand pros/cons of each


## What makes a successful workflow?

It *should* enhance the effectiveness of your team

It *should not* be a burden


## What makes a successful workflow? | Considerations

* Does this workflow scale with team size?

> - Is it easy to undo mistakes & errors?

> - Does it impose unnecessary overhead?


## Models for workflows

### Centralized

### Feature branch

### Forking


# Centralized workflow


## Centralized workflow | Uses a single repo for all changes to the project

## Centralized workflow | John works on his code

## Centralized workflow

## Centralized workflow | Mary works on her code

![](images/central_ex_2.svg)


## Centralized workflow | John pushes his commits `(git push origin main)`

![](images/central_ex_3.svg)


## Centralized workflow | Mary tries to push, but it fails  `(git push origin main)`

![](images/central_ex_4.svg)


## Centralized workflow | Mary *rebases* `(git pull --rebase origin main)`

![](images/central_ex_5.svg)


## Centralized workflow | `rebase` moves Mary's commits to tip

## Centralized workflow | Mary resolves her *merge conflict*

## Centralized workflow

![](images/mary_repo.png)

```
git add
git rebase --continue
```

## Centralized workflow | Mary pushes her commits `(git push origin main)`

# Feature branch workflow


## Feature branch workflow | How it works

* A central repo with a `main` branch for official history

> - Developers create a new branch for every new feature

> - Updates are made via *pull requests*


## Pull requests

* Changes are not immediately merged into `main` branch

> - Rather, the `feature` branch is pushed to remote repo

> - Changes are reviewed by the team

> - Accepted changes are merged into `main` and pushed to remote repo


## Feature branch | Mary creates a new development branch 

![](images/branch_ex_1.svg)

```
git checkout -b marys-feature main
```


## Feature branch | Mary pushes `(git push -u origin marys-feature)` 

![](images/branch_ex_2.svg)


## Feature branch | Mary finishes her changes & submits a pull request

![](images/branch_ex_3.svg)


## Feature branch | John receives pull request

![](images/branch_ex_4.svg)


## Feature branch | John & Mary discuss changes

![](images/branch_ex_4.svg)


## Feature branch | Mary makes changes

![](images/branch_ex_5.svg)


## Feature branch | Changes are accepted & merged (by John or Mary)

![](images/branch_ex_6.svg)

<br>

```
## switch to main branch
git checkout main
## pull changes from main
git pull
## pull changes from feature
git pull origin marys-feature
## push changes to main
git push 
```


## What's next?

We'll learn about GitHub and how to use it for personal and collaborative projects
