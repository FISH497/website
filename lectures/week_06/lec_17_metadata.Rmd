## Goals for today

* Understand the concept of *metadata*

> - Understand the different kinds of metadata

> - Get an introduction to the *Ecological Metadata Language*


## What is metadata? | Definition

"data that provides information about other data"


## What is metadata? | Definition

"shorthand representation of the data to which they refer"


## Metadata is everywhere | Book

* title  
* author  
* publisher  
* copyright  
* table of contents / index  


## Metadata is everywhere | Phone calls

* number called or received from  
* time initiated & ended  
* location of callers  


## Metadata is everywhere | Email

* subject  
* from  
* to  
* date & time sent  
* sending & receiving IP addresses  


## Kinds of metadata | Descriptive

*Descriptive metadata* is information about a resource that is used for searching & identification

> - title  
> - abstract  
> - author  
> - keywords


## Kinds of metadata | Structural

*Structural metadata* indicates how 2+ objects are connected

> - tables    
> - fields 
> - keys  
> - relationships  


## Entity–relationship model

Structural metadata are often conceptualized in an *entity–relationship model* 


## Entity–relationship model | Entity

An *entity* can be physical or logical

> - physical entities *actually* exist (eg, lake, fish)

> - logical entities *could* exist (eg, a sampling event)

> - entities have attributes (eg, depth, mass, date)


## Entity–relationship model | Relationship

Entities are connected via a *relationship*

> - relationships can be thought of as verbs

> - Sarah *supervises* Mark

> - Omar *samples* Lake Washington


## Entity–relationship diagram

ER models are usually drawn as boxes (entities) connected by lines (relationships)

## Kinds of metadata | Administrative

Administrative metadata refers to technical info about a data file

> - file type (eg, `.csv`)  
> - when the file was created
> - how the file was created


## Administrative metadata | Rights management

> - Who has had custody/ownership of the data?  
> - What intellectual property rights must be observed?


## Administrative metadata | Preservation

> - Where are the data stored?  
> - How are they identified (eg, digitial object identifier)?  


## Kinds of metadata | Reference

Information about the contents and quality of statistical data

> - description of fields  
> - QA/QC


## Kinds of metadata | Process

Describes the collection and any processing of the data

> - raw vs cleaned
> - reproducible workflows


## Kinds of metadata | Accessibility

Information about improved access to data

> - audio transcripts  
> - alternate text for an image  
> - large print
