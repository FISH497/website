## Goals for today

* Understand the forms of *research compendia*

> - Understand the concept of *design documents*

> - Understand how to ask for help


## The reproducibility crisis in science

### We are witnessing an increasing number of examples where the original analysis cannot be reproduced

> - For example, a group of Amgen scientists could only confirm the results in 6 out of 53 cancer studies (Begley & Ellis 2012) 


## What does it mean to be reproducible?

According to the National Science Foundation:

The calculation of quantitative scientific results by independent researchers using the original data and methods


## What does it mean to be reproducible?

Reproducible can be further broken down

> - empirical (eg, sample identities, sampling gear, instrument settings)

> - statistical (eg, which statistical tests, what model parameters)

> - computational (eg, code, software, hardware)


## What is a research compendium?

"A standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a project to enable others to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research." (Marwick et al. 2018)


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

> - The community might be a lab group

> - The convention(s) support tool building


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

2. Maintain a clear separation of data, methods and output

> - Separate data from code

> - Separate cleaning, analysis & output code


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

2. Maintain a clear separation of data, methods and output

3. Specify the computational environment

> - Which packages and what version?

> - Ranges from simple text description to self-contained environments
