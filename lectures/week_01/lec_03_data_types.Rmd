## Goals for today

* Understand the forms of *research compendia*



## The reproducibility crisis in science

### We are witnessing an increasing number of examples where the original analysis cannot be reproduced

> - For example, a group of Amgen scientists could only confirm the results in 6 out of 53 cancer studies (Begley & Ellis 2012) 


## What does it mean to be reproducible?

According to the National Science Foundation:

The calculation of quantitative scientific results by independent researchers using the original data and methods


## What does it mean to be reproducible?

Reproducible can be further broken down

> - empirical (eg, sample identities, sampling gear, instrument settings)

> - statistical (eg, which statistical tests, what model parameters)

> - computational (eg, code, software, hardware)


## What is a research compendium?

"A standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a project to enable others to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research." (Marwick et al. 2018)


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

> - The community might be a lab group

> - The convention(s) support tool building


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

2. Maintain a clear separation of data, methods and output

> - Separate data from code

> - Separate cleaning, analysis & output code


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

2. Maintain a clear separation of data, methods and output

3. Specify the computational environment

> - Which software/package(s) and what version(s)?

> - Ranges from simple text description to self-contained environments


## Why use a research compendium?

> - Increased efficiency, simplified file management and streamlined workflows

> - Increased visibility and scientific impact

> - Ability to return later and understand the process


## Creating a research compendium | Key principle

Organize your compendium so another person can know what to expect from the plain meaning of the file and directory names


## Simple compendium {data-background=compendium_1.png data-background-size=45% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Simple compendium {data-background=compendium_2.png data-background-size=45% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Medium compendium {data-background=compendium_3.png data-background-size=30% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Large {data-background=compendium_4.png data-background-size=30% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

> - Who can (re)use the work?

> - Are there restrictions?

> - Many depositories require Creative Commons licenses


## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

2. Version control

> - Facilitates private collaboration among colleagues on the project

> - Allows for distribution and maintenance of the compendium in the future


## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

2. Version control

3. Persistence

> - Consider the "life span" of the analysis

> - A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is more permanent than a URL



## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

2. Version control

3. Persistence

4. Metadata

> - Publishing data with a DOI requires a description of the data themselves

> - Who, what, where, when, how


## Tools for creating a compendium

One could always create a structure from scratch

Alternatively, consider some existing tools

> - Jeff Hollister's [{manuscriptPackage}](https://github.com/jhollist/manuscriptPackage)

> - Carl Boettiger's [{template}](https://github.com/cboettig/template)

> - Ben Marwick's [{rrtools}](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools)


## A note on directory structure | Does your code begin with something like this? {.smaller}

`setwd("/Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/final_code")`


## Relative vs absolute paths

Use relative paths to your work

The [{here}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html) package makes this really easy

```
## Absolute path
## /Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/data

## Relative path
> data_dir <- here::here("data")
> data_dir
> [1] "/Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/data"
```


# Coding styles


## File & code names | 3 principles

1. Human readable

> - The name should convey concise info

> - Longer is better


## File & code names | 3 principles

1. Human readable

2. Machine readable

> - Easy to ID with *regular expressions* or *globbing*

> - Avoid spaces, capitalization, punctuation, special characters

> - Consider `_` and `-` as delimiters


## Example file names

### Bad

* `resume.docx`

* `Mark's data.xlsx`

* `figure 1.pdf`

### Good

* `scheuerell_resume_2021-01-01.docx`

* `marks_skagit_steelhead_age_composition.xlsx`

* `figure_01_scatterplot_length_mass.pdf`


## File & code names | 3 principles

1. Human readable

2. Machine readable

3. Works with default ordering

> - Use a number at the beginning of a name

> - Use the ISO standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD)

> - "zero-pad" numbers


## Example file names

### Chronological order

```
2019-10-20_skagit_harvest-commerical.csv
2019-10-20_skagit_harvest-recreational.csv
2020-09-18_nooksack_harvest-commerical.csv
2020-09-18_nooksack_harvest-recreational.csv
```

### Logical order

```
01_data-ingest.R
02_data-cleaning.R
03_model-fitting.R
04_create-figures.R
```
