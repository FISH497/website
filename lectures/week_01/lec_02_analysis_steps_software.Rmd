## Goals for today

* Outline the steps to a data science analysis

* Understand the software requirements for the course

> - Verify that you have the software installed and working


## Steps to an analysis

1. Define the question of interest  
2. Get the data  
3. Clean the data  
4. Explore the data  
5. Fit statistical models  
6. Communicate the results  
7. Make your analysis reproducible  


## Steps to an analysis | 1. Define the question of interest  

What makes a good Q?

> - It should be specific  
> - It should be answerable with available data
> - It should come with a definition of success  
> - It should not be designed to discriminate or cause harm


## Steps to an analysis | 2. Get the data  

Data sources:

> - You collected your own  
> - Collaborators  
> - Public repositories


## Steps to an analysis | 3. Clean the data  

This is usually the most time intensive step

It's also the most important & the hardest to teach

## Steps to an analysis | 4. Explore the data  

Do the data meet your expectations?

> - Make judicious use of plots

> - Also consider correlation matrics (eg, [{corrplot}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html))

> - Beware of data mining!


## Steps to an analysis | 5. Fit statistical models  

Where to start?

> - Start with first principles

> - Keep it simple


## Steps to an analysis | 6. Communicate the results  

Choose your medium

> - Social media, blog posts

> - Presentation

> - manuscript


## Steps to an analysis | 7. Make your analysis reproducible  

Consider these scenarios

> - "Can you re-run the analysis with these new data?"

> - "Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you donâ€™t reply to emails" (Karl Broman)


# Software requirements

## R Software | An environment for statistical computing and graphics

> - It's FREE!

> - Enormous developer & support communities

> - [Learn more here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)


## R packages

* Most of R's current capabilities come from *packages*

> - We'll use a variety of them for many different tasks

> - We'll also learn how to create our own!


## RStudio | An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

> - Syntax highlighting, code completion, smart indentation  

> - Easily manage multiple working directories using projects  

> - Extensive package development tools  

> - Built-in tools & GUIs for **Git** & **R Markdown**

## RStudio benefits

### [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

<br>

### [Webinars, links, etc](https://resources.rstudio.com/)


## &nbsp; {data-background=RStudio_cheatsheet.png data-background-size=cover}


## GitHub | Cloud-based code repository & collaboration platform

> - Store, manage, track changes to code

> - Communicate with other team members

> - Uses **Git** for version control


## &nbsp; {data-background=GitHub_repo.png data-background-size=100%}


## Git | Version control system (VCS)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/about) records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later


## PostgreSQL | Open source relational database system

> - Uses & extends the SQL language

> - Highly extensible (eg, define your own data types)

> - Active user community


## R Markdown

Notebook interface to weave together text, equations, and code into nicely formatted output

Allows you to create and document fully reproducible workflows


## R Markdown

Supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats

* HTML  
* PDF  
* MS Word  
* HTML5 slides  
* Books  
* Shiny apps  
* Scientific articles  
* websites
