## Goals for today

* Examine the steps to a data science analysis

* Understand the software requirements for the course

> - Verify that you have the software installed and working


## Steps to an analysis


# Software requirements

## R Software | An environment for statistical computing and graphics

> - It's FREE!

> - Enormous developer & support communities

> - [Learn more here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)


## R packages

* Most of R's current capabilities come from *packages*

> - We'll use a variety of them for many different tasks

> - We'll also learn how to create our own!


## RStudio | An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

> - Syntax highlighting, code completion, smart indentation  

> - Easily manage multiple working directories using projects  

> - Extensive package development tools  

> - Built-in tools & GUIs for **Git** & **R Markdown**

## RStudio benefits

### [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

<br>

### [Webinars, links, etc](https://resources.rstudio.com/)


## &nbsp; {data-background=RStudio_cheatsheet.png data-background-size=cover}


## GitHub | Cloud-based code repository & collaboration platform

> - Store, manage, track changes to code

> - Communicate with other team members

> - Uses **Git** for version control


## &nbsp; {data-background=GitHub_repo.png data-background-size=100%}


## Git | Version control system (VCS)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/about) records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later


## PostgreSQL | Open source relational database system

> - Uses & extends the SQL language

> - Highly extensible (eg, define your own data types)

> - Active user community


## R Markdown

Notebook interface to weave together text, equations, and code into nicely formatted output

Allows you to create and document fully reproducible workflows


## R Markdown

Supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats

* HTML  
* PDF  
* MS Word  
* HTML5 slides  
* Books  
* Shiny apps  
* Scientific articles  
* websites
