# Background

One of the great features of **R Markdown** is using it to create static websites. These websites can be quite simple with only a single page or more complex with multiple pages and options, such as the website for this course. Websites created with **R Markdown** can be viewed/hosted directly on **GitHub** or [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/), or copied over to a server such as http://students.washington.edu.

***

# Setup

For this exercise, we'll create a simple personal website and host it on **GitHub**. Although you can disply a static website from any **GitHub** repo, we'll use special repo with the same name as your **GitHub** username.

## Create a repo

Create a new repo on GitHub called `your_user_name` where `your_user_name` is your actual GitHub username. As soon as you've typed your full username into the `Repository name` box, GitHub should respond with a message in a green box below it about you having just found a secret and that this is a special repo (see image below).

In the **Description** box, type (or copy/paste) "This is the development repo for my personal website".

Make the repo **Public**.

Despite GitHub's urging, **DO NOT** add a README, .gitignore or license file.

Click the green **Create repository** button when you're finished.

```{r gh_create_repo, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gh_create_repo.png")
```

<br>

## Create RStudio project

The next step is to create a new project in **RStudio**. However, rather than base this new project on an existing repo, as we've done in the past, we'll instead choose **New Directory**.

```{r rs_new_proj, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rs_new_project.png")
```

<br>

Scroll down the options for **Project Type** and select `Postcards Website`.

```{r rs_postcards, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rs_postcards.png")
```

<br>

In the next **Create Postcards Website** window, enter your own **GitHub** username in the field for `Directory name:`

Choose the location where you'd like this new project to live.

Select the `Trestles` template from the drop-down menu.

When you are finished, check the box next to `Open in new session` and click the **Create Project** button.

```{r rs_postcards_details, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rs_postcards_details.png")
```
